title: Life outside the office
---

Outside of scholastic and professional pursuits, I have a lot of life I'm 
living. It's increasingly important to me to write down my experiences, and I'm
attempting to share more freely those experiences with anyone who cares to hear 
them.
There are many things that make me who I am. I am fun-loving and rarely serious,
but I am also intensely spiritual and always hoping to make someone else's life
better.

Before I am anything, I am a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng). Every week I spend hours
studying the restored gospel, and occasionally write up 
{{< staticref "spiritual" >}}thoughts{{< /staticref >}} to be
shared on this site.

Another writing project I've taken up is to occasionally respond to the prompts
from the Wall Street Journal 
[Future View](https://www.wsj.com/news/types/future-view) opinion page. 
I read from
several major newspapers, but the one I read most and the only one of which I'm
a subscriber is the WSJ. I dream that one day the Journal will sketch my face
and print it with a published article. A good start would be to have one of my
250 word 
{{< staticref "personal/futureview" >}}opinions{{< /staticref >}} published.
