title: Life outside the office
---

Outside of scholastic and professional pursuits, I have a lot of life I'm 
living. It's increasingly important to me to write down my experiences, and I'm
attempting to share more freely those experiences with anyone who cares to know.
There are many things that make me who I am. I am fun-loving and rarely serious,
but I am also intensely spiritual and always hoping to make someone else's life
better.

Before I am anything, I am a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng). Every week I spend hours
studying the restored gospel, and just recently began writing some of my 
{{< staticref "personal/spiritual" >}}thoughts{{< /staticref >}} to 
share on this site.
