Over the past few years, a number of events around the globe have exposed the fragility of our way of life. A global pandemic, political/social turmoil and a full-blown war in mainland Europe have given a person ample reason to feel on edge. Apocalyptic reports on climate change and a ballooning national debt only add to the dismal anticipation felt by many. 

A good school friend of mine more than once has expressed to me the anxiety he feels about both the present state of the world but even more about the future world's future state. Our conversations are generally light-hearted, filled with jabs and jokes, but more than once when joking about a future civil war or widespread famine he's said more seriously, "You realize I'm only half joking right?" In one conversation, we were discussing hot political topics which to some portend serious problems for the future. Drawing from the great 20th century economist John Maynard Keynes, I quipped "At least 'in the long run we are all dead.'" 

My friend's reaction to the wisecrack should not have surprised me, but it did. With a slightly more serious demeanor, he expressed that he actually takes comfort in the fact that he will one day die, because no matter how far south things go or how much he "screws things up," he will one day not have to worry about those things because he'll be dead.  

Having this conversation and knowing that my friend's feelings are not unique led me to ask hard questions. Why is fear so pervasive in society? Why don't I have the same anxiety as others? Would I be better off with more trepidation for the future? Once while musing on these things part of an interview between the 60 Minutes talk show host Mike Wallace and President Gordon B. Hinckley came to my mind. Speaking about the aged condition of church leadership, the following question was given and answered.

**Mike Wallace:** *There are those who say, this is a gerontocracy, this is a church run by old men.*

**Gordon B. Hinckley:** *Isn't it wonderful? To have a man of maturity at the head, a man of judgment, who isn't blown about by every wind of doctrine?*
