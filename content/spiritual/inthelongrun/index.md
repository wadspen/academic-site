One of my good friends from graduate school would often visit my office 

I've spent much time wondering why it is that many people have so much trepidation about the future. I've asked myself why I don't have more trepidation and if it would be better to have more. Once while musing on these things part of an interview between the 60 Minutes talk show host Mike Wallace and President Gordon B. Hinckley came to my mind. Speaking about the aged condition of church leadership, the following question was given and answered.

**Mike Wallace:** There are those who say, this is a gerontocracy, this is a church run by old men.

**Gordon B. Hinckley:** Isn't it wonderful? To have a man of maturity at the head, a man of judgment, who isn't blown about by every wind of doctrince?
