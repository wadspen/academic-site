Over the past few years, a number of events around the globe have exposed the fragility of the way of life in the western world. A global pandemic, political/social turmoil and a full-blown war in mainland Europe have given any person ample reason to feel on edge. Apocalyptic reports on climate change and a ballooning national debt only add to the dismal anticipation felt by many. 

A good school friend of mine more than once has expressed to me the anxiety he feels about both the present state of the world but even more about the world's future state. Our conversations are generally light-hearted, filled with jabs and jokes, but more than once when joking about fear of a future civil war or widespread famine due to man's unpardonable actions he's said more seriously, "You realize I'm only half joking right?" In one such conversation, we were discussing hot political topics which to some portend serious problems for the future. Drawing from the great 20th century economist John Maynard Keynes, I quipped "At least 'in the long run we are all dead.'" 

My friend's reaction to the wisecrack should not have surprised me like it did. With a slightly more serious demeanor, he expressed that he actually takes comfort in Mr. Keynes words, because no matter how far south things go or how much he "screws things up," he will one day not have to worry about it because he'll be dead.  

Having this conversation and knowing that my friend's feelings are not unique led me to ask hard questions. Why is fear so pervasive in society? How can that fear be replaced with hope? Why don't I have the same anxiety as others? Would I be better off if I had more trepidation for the future? Once while musing on these, part of an interview between the 60 Minutes talk show host Mike Wallace and President Gordon B. Hinckley came to my mind. Speaking about the aged condition of church leadership, the following exchange occurred.

**Mike Wallace:** *There are those who say, this is a gerontocracy, this is a church run by old men.*

**Gordon B. Hinckley:** *Isn't it wonderful? To have a man of maturity at the head, a man of judgment, who isn't blown about by every wind of doctrine?*

Over the years I've thought back many times to this exchange between the world renowned journalist and the Lord's prophet. In the present context, however, the lesson conveyed by President Hinckley answered my hard questions and one which I think/hope will stick forever. That lesson summarized: If I follow God's prophet and put my trust in his teachings given from the Savior, I have no reason to worry about the future. 

Most people invest high levels of trust in other people. Beliefs of politicians, celebrities, corporate leaders, scientists, etc. become the sandy bedrock upon which people build their own beliefs and even their lives. Not all philosophies from these "influencers" are necessarily toxic, but many are and all are both temporary and fallible. Some influencers appear to be no more than false prophets. The Lord declared "by their fruits ye shall know them." It takes little effort to see that the fruits of many -- and today this seems especially true of politicians and scientists -- are confusion, fear, and anger. Reaping such fruit will keep anyone from looking forward with optimism.

In stark contrast, the Lord's prophets teach doctrine
