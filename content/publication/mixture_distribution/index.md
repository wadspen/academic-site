abstract: Collaboration among multiple teams has played a major role in probabilistic forecasting
events of influenza outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic, other disease outbreaks, and in many
other fields. When collecting forecasts from individual teams, ensuring that each teamâ€™s model
represents forecast uncertainty according to the same format allows for direct comparison of
forecasts as well as methods of constructing multi-model ensemble forecasts. This paper outlines
several common probabilistic forecast representation formats including parametric distributions,
sample distributions, bin distributions, and quantiles and compares their use in the context of
collaborative projects. We propose the use of a discrete mixture distribution format in
collaborative forecasting in place of other formats. The flexibility in distribution shape, the ease
for scoring and building ensemble models, and the reasonably low level of computer storage
required to store such a forecast make the discrete mixture distribution an attractive alternative
to the other representation formats.
